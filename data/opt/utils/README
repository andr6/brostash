Collection of Script to Tune/Lock down the bro sensor.
# IPTABLES:
The script iptables configures the host firewall to allow only inbound ssh/http(s) connections.
This enough if the bro service is not connected to another host as part of a bro cluster.

# NIC Tunning:
The script interface-tuneup disables NIC offloading.
